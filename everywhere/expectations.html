<p class="text">A liesurely paced dinner with your partner or group! Our seats are deep and comfortable, our
lighting low and augmented with fireplaces and candles. Traveling the world culinarily should not
be rushed. We are a bring your own bottle establishment, so start off by giving us your bottles
and we will chill and serve accordingly. Our dishes can be ordered individually and gradually
over the course of your evening or you can order from the curated flights. When ordering flights
the plates will not come out all at one time. We want you to be able to enjoy the taste in front of 
you without other plates getting cold. You may want to order a bread basket if you don't want an
empty table, even for a few minutes. The other advantage is you can use the bread to get every last
drop of flavor off the plate!</p>
